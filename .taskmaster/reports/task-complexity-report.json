      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the search page module implementation into focused subtasks covering: (1) DOM selector mapping for search results and navigation chrome, (2) SearchPageSettings interface extension with navigation controls matching HomePageSettings structure, (3) content type detection utilities (isShortContent, isCommunityPost, isLongFormVideo, isMixPlaylist, isSponsoredContent), (4) CSS generation function with navigation chrome hiding and visual centering matching home-page.ts design pattern, (5) settings application via CSS injection using injectCSS helper, (6) MutationObserver for infinite scroll filtering with 200ms debouncing, (7) YouTube SPA navigation detection and lifecycle management (setupNavigationListener, isSearchPage, initSearchPageModule, cleanupSearchPageModule), (8) performance optimizations (requestAnimationFrame batching, selector caching) and edge case handling (empty results, unusual content, filter interactions), (9) dual-mode navigation verification ensuring both SPA mode (yt-navigate-finish event) and direct URL navigation (https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=...) work correctly. Each subtask should follow the proven architectural patterns from home-page.ts (lines 1-387) while adapting to search page requirements including comprehensive navigation chrome hiding to match minimalist Home Page design.",
      "reasoning": "Complexity score of 7/10 is justified by: (1) Need to create multiple new files from scratch (search-page.ts, content-filter.ts), (2) Navigation chrome hiding adds significant architectural scope beyond basic content filtering, mirroring home-page.ts complexity, (3) Dual-mode navigation support (SPA + direct URL) requires careful lifecycle management and initialization timing, (4) Content type detection requires deep understanding of YouTube's dynamic DOM structure, (5) Infinite scroll with MutationObserver requires performance optimization (debouncing, selector caching), (6) Visual consistency requirement with Home Page demands precise CSS generation and layout management. However, complexity is reduced by: (1) Strong reference implementation in home-page.ts (387 lines) providing proven patterns for CSS injection, navigation detection, and observer setup, (2) All DOM helper utilities (waitForElement, injectCSS, removeCSS, debounce) already implemented in dom-helpers.ts, (3) Type infrastructure and settings schema established in settings.ts, only requiring extension, (4) No novel technical challenges - follows established patterns. 9 subtasks already defined provide appropriate granularity for implementation: selector mapping → type extensions → detection utilities → CSS generation → CSS application → mutation observation → navigation lifecycle → optimizations → dual-mode verification. This represents a medium-to-high complexity feature requiring careful attention to architectural consistency and performance."
