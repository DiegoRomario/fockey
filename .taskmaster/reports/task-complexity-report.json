      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Creator Profile Page implementation into focused subtasks covering: (1) Core module setup with TypeScript interfaces and selector definitions, (2) CSS injection system for hiding navigation chrome and promotional elements, (3) Dynamic content filtering for Shorts/Community posts across different tabs, (4) MutationObserver setup with debouncing for performance, (5) Settings integration in Options.tsx with accordion UI, (6) Popup quick toggles for most-used settings, (7) Content orchestrator integration with page type detection, and (8) Comprehensive testing across channel URL formats and authentication states. Each subtask should result in working, tested code following established patterns from tasks 6, 7, and 9.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate-to-high complexity (7/10) due to several factors:\n\n**Complexity Drivers:**\n- **Multiple URL format support**: Must handle 4 different channel URL patterns (/@username, /c/, /user/, /channel/)\n- **Granular settings system**: 14 different boolean settings requiring UI organization and state management\n- **Dynamic content filtering**: Must detect and filter Shorts/Community posts across 3 different tab contexts (Videos, Home, Playlists)\n- **Performance optimization**: Requires debounced MutationObserver, CSS containment, requestIdleCallback usage\n- **Authentication-dependent testing**: Elements like Subscribe/Join buttons only appear when logged in, requiring conditional test strategies\n\n**Mitigating Factors:**\n- **Established patterns**: Can follow proven architecture from tasks 6 (Home Page), 7 (Search Page), and 9 (Watch Page)\n- **Clear specification**: Detailed implementation steps with exact selector definitions and code examples\n- **Reusable components**: shadcn/ui components and storage abstraction already implemented (tasks 2, 4)\n- **No API integration**: Pure DOM manipulation without network requests\n\n**Subtask Rationale (8 recommended):**\n1. Core module structure & TypeScript definitions\n2. CSS generation & injection system\n3. Content filtering logic for Shorts/Community\n4. MutationObserver with performance optimizations\n5. Options page UI integration\n6. Popup quick toggles integration\n7. Content orchestrator wiring\n8. Testing & validation suite\n\nThis breakdown balances granularity with efficiency, allowing parallel work on UI (5-6) vs. core logic (1-4) while ensuring proper integration (7-8)."
